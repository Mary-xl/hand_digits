This project intend to summarise different machine learning approaches of solving hand-digit recognition problems as a demo for more complex problems, including:
(1) Using SVM for hand digits recognition;
(2) Using KNN for hand digits recognition;
(3) Using CNN for hand digits recognition;
(4) Autoencoder and content-based image retrieval;
